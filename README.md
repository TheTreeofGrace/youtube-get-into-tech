## Challenge: 
Get started with this react node js tutorial and commit it to your github repo.
https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app

## Help:
You might need to install nodejs on your machine. Visit here: https://nodejs.org/en/

If nodejs is installed then run the following command: 

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run start

Commit the application to your repository
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m 'created react app'
git push
